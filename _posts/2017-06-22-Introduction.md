title: "Everything has to start somewhere"
---

Everyone needs a web presence these days and I have been dragging my feet on
building mine for a while. I have attempted to start up Blogger and WordPress
blogs before, but I really just found the process tedious. Writing a blog post
in a text box felt so odd and uncomfortable, considering I spend my days in a
plain-ole' text editor at work. Then I discovered Jekyll and GitHub Pages and
experienced an epiphany. Blogging in a Git workflow just makes sense to my
brain.

I currently work as a software engineer at Intel Corporation. Let it be known
that the thoughts I express here are my own and not that of my employer. I work
in a team that develops software interfaces for high speed networks. You can see
some of the cool work we are doing at the
[libfabric](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric) repository on GitHub.

This blog does not have any particular theme. I expect that software, politics,
and science will be visited often, but the possibilities are endless. I hope
anyone reading these posts will enjoy them as much as I enjoy writing them. Feel
free to contact me with your feedback.
